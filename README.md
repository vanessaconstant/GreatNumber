# Great Number - Guess the correct number!

Guess a number between 1 and 100
Create a site that allows a user to play this guessing game. Upon loading, the server should "pick" a random number between 1-100; store the number in session. Allow the user to guess the number--tell them when they are too high or too low. If they guess the correct number, notify them and offer to play again.
